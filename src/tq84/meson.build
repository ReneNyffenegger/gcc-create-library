# We use libtool-version numbers because it's easier to understand.
# Before making a release, the libruntime_so_*
# numbers should be modified. The components are of the form C:R:A.
# a) If binary compatibility has been broken (eg removed or changed interfaces)
#    change to C+1:0:0.
# b) If interfaces have been changed or added, but binary compatibility has
#    been preserved, change to C+1:0:A+1
# c) If the interface is the same as the previous version, change to C:R+1:A
