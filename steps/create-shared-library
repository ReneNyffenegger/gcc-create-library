#
#  In order to create a shared library, position independent code
#  must be generated. This can be achieved with `-fPIC` flag when
#  c-files are compiled.
#
#  If the object files are created without -fPIC (such as when the static object files are produces), then
#      gcc -shared bin/static/add.o bin/static/answer.o -o bin/shared/libtq84.so
#  produces this error:
#     /usr/bin/ld: bin/tq84.o: relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `gSummand' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
