#   Both, the position independent and position dependent object
#   files can be used to statically link an executable:
#
gcc bin/tq84.o     bin/main.o -o bin/statically-linked
gcc bin/tq84-PIC.o bin/main.o -o bin/statically-linked-PIC

# The files can now be execucted with
#   bin/statically-linked
#   bin/statically-linked-PIC
